# Welcome to the Teia Docs Wiki

This is a local edit made in a branch.

With this action, files are updated in the main repo and then pushed to the
wiki repo.

What happens when someone uses the GitHub UI to edit a document?

Updating from the GitHub UI again.

This edit is from the GitHub repository browser interface. Where you can also edit documents.  Not to be confused with the Wiki interface which is different.

When you use the browser interface, it also gives you the option of creating a Pull Request.  Although I think of it more as a Merge Request when you are merging a change from a branch in the same repository.
